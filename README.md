# belief-propagation-message-passing
This repo contains the codes to compute the magnetization at a given temperature for a Ising spin model on a Erdős–Rényi random graph (ERRG) via **message-passing (belief-propagatation/cavity method)**. </br>
Results are then compared with the magnetization obtained via Monte Carlo simulations.

Some reference to the methods used:</br>

The algorithm is known "cavity method" in the physics community and "message-passing" or "belief-propagation" in the computer science community. </br>

# belief-propagation-message-passing
This repo contains the codes to compute the magnetization at a given temperature for a Ising spin model on a Erdős–Rényi random graph (ERRG) via message-passing (belief-propgatation/cavity method).
Results are then compared with the magnetization obtained via Monte Carlo simulations.
